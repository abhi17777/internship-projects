hello world.
Goodbye World.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
I have nothing to declare except my genius.
To be, or not to be: that is the question.
That which does not kill us makes us stronger.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
You must be the change you wish to see in the world.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success.
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
The quick brown fox jumps over the Lazy Dog.
The early bird catches the worm.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
The Art of War.
The hills are alive with the sound of music.
The Fault in Our Stars.
The Da Vinci Code.
The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas.
