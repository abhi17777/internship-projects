Goodbye World, goodbye Spark
Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.
Live long and prosper.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
Hasta la vista, baby.
The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.
Everything you can imagine is real.
The only thing standing between you and your goal is the story you keep telling yourself.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
Let's go, my Friend!
You only live once!
To be or not to be, that is the question!
The Great Gatsby.
The sound of silence.
The Silence of the Lambs.
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
The Green Mile.
The Perks of Being a Wallflower.
