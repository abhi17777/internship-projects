Goodbye Spark.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
I have a dream.
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.
Here's looking at you, kid.
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by.
Be the change that you wish to see in the world.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
You may be disappointed if you fail, but you are doomed if you don't try.
The best way to predict the future is to create it.
You are amazing!
The Sun rises in the East.
I love Chocolate Ice Cream.
It's raining cats and dogs!
